# Hello!
I am Elias Trommer, a computer scientist (M.Sc.) working in the field of machine learning on resource-constrained devices.  
I am currently employed at [Infineon Technologies Dresden](https://www.infineon.com/cms/dresden/de/) where I pursue a Ph.D. degree under the supervision of [Prof. Akash Kumar](https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/pd-staff-kumar) from the [TU Dresden Chair of Processor Design](https://cfaed.tu-dresden.de/pd-about). A list of my publications can be found on my [résumé](resume).  

My research and productive code can be found on my [professional Github
account](https://github.com/etrommer). Tinkering, experiments and abandoned projects are usually in my [private Github account](https://github.com/jadeaffenjaeger).

In the rare moments where I don't sit in front of a screen I enjoy hiking, bike touring or reading a novel.

Here are some technologies that I enjoy working with, in no particular order:  
_Python, numpy, scikit-learn, pytorch, KiCAD, C, Rust, Git, Zola, MLFlow, RISC-V, ARM Cortex-M MCUs, Autodesk Fusion 360, Cura_
